Practice naming the squares as either white or black

### Different modes 
- name the square
    
    control by typing or by voice (voice doesn't work well but it's trying its best be nice)
- click the square that is named

sorry if the layout doesn't work with your browser size - i haven't gotten to the flexbox section of my css class yet :]
